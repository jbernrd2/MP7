     * This example shows how to use buffer swapping.
     *
     * Zen maintains two image buffers. The foreground buffer is currently displayed; the background
     * buffer is not. A complete image can be assembled unseen in the background buffer. The buffers
     * are then swapped and the image is then visible to the user.
     *
     * This is a very common technique in graphics stacks. First, it allows us to restart rendering
     * from a blank canvas without worrying about what might have been drawn previously.
     *
     * In addition, assembling an entire window can require a lot of computation and compositing of
     * multiple layers. For example, on Android the smartphone platform is responsible for drawing
     * the top and bottom of the display, while the application draws the middle. These two parts
     * have to be combined before the image is displayed to the user. Buffer swapping ensures that
     * users never see the screen in an incomplete state. All assembly takes place on the unseen
     * buffer.
     *
